就在近期石川縣政府對外宣布，在珠洲市的一座廢棄操場，發現了一具長約11.5公尺寬約3.5公尺的奇異生物骨骸化石。現場已經封鎖，並已有相關考古團隊進駐，主導考古調查與開挖。考古坑挖掘面積長約13公尺、寬6.5公尺、深約1.5公尺。該生物骨骸化石相當完整，狀似鯨魚骸骨，但該骸骨有著兩隻前鰭與兩隻巨大的後足。

Recently, the Ishikawa county government has publicly announced the uncovering of a skeleton fossil of a mysterious creature roughly the size of 11.5 meters in length and 3.5 meters in width.

Situated at an abandoned field in Suzu City, the site is now sealed off, restricted to archaeological teams stationed for further investigation and excavation work. The archaeological dig ranges 13 meters in length, 6.5 meters in width, and 1.5 meters in depth. 

The skeleton fossil of the creature comes across as somewhat complete, resembling a whale skeleton plus additional two front fins and two huge hind feet.

根據最近古生物學家在祕魯發現一具保存完好的「陸行鯨 」Ambulocetus natans化石，有下顎、牙齒，四條腿和蹼狀腳趾的特徵，和半水生哺乳動物 的尾部脊椎骨，牠被考古學家認為是鯨魚的祖先。在珠洲市發現的這個生物骨骸化石是否是類似陸行鯨的生物？或者是陸行鯨演化到鯨魚更直接的證據？

Based on the recent paleontological discovery in Peru, the walking whale,  Ambulocetus natans, is now considered by archaeologists to be the ancestor of whales. They uncovered a well-preserved fossil, including a lower jaw with teeth, four legs, webbed toes, and the caudal vertebra of a semi-aquatic mammal. 

So, is the skeleton fossil found in Suzu City of a creature similar to the walking whale? Or is it direct evidence of the walking whales evolving to whales?

位在石川縣能登町的真脇市，早在1981年便發現標記著繩文時代（距今約6000-2000年前）的「真脅遺址」。其中有著大量的海豚遺骨及鯨魚遺骨，證實了自兩千年前，人們便有捕食鯨魚的文化。在江戶時代平均一年也有捕獲幾十頭鯨魚的紀錄。自古以來若是有個村莊捕獲鯨魚，鯨魚肉一半給捕獲的村，其他一半分給周邊六個村莊。所以每當有鯨魚出現，七個村莊都因此得利。

As early as 1981, the Mawaki Site of the Jōmon period (two to six thousand years from now) was discovered in the Mawaki neighbourhood of Noto City, Ishikawa. 

A large amount of dolphin and whale bones became evidence of the culture of whale hunting at the time of two thousand years back. In the Edo period, there were records of dozens of whales getting caught on a yearly average. 

Since ancient times, if one village fished a whale, it would get half of the whale meat as the six nearby villages would share the other half. So every time a whale showed up, all seven villages would benefit from it.

另珠州市當地的慰靈碑上記載著三次鯨魚的擱淺，分別發生在明治及昭和時代。「明治11年月日不詳，鰐崎海岸，白長鬚鯨，體長35米。昭和36年2月11日，赤神海岸，白長鬚鯨，體長10米。昭和62年1月9日，白山海岸，鰯鯨。」這個碑文正是感念鯨魚擱淺犧牲，造福當地住民的生活，感恩祈福冥界獸靈所立下。而這個考古遺跡的出土，也顯示著當地和鯨魚的密切關係，有了另一個歷史證據。

On the local memorial monument in Suzu City, there is a record of three whale-stranding incidents. ‘Date unknown, Meiji 11. 

Wanizaki coast. White fin whale. 35-meter long; February 11, Showa 36. Akakami coast. White fin whale. 10-meter long; January 9, Showa 62. Hakusan coast. Sei whale.’ The inscription commemorates the sacrificial offering of whale stranding, recognising the resulting benefits of the lives of the residents, who are grateful for the blessings established by the beastly spirits of the underworld. 

As historical evidence, the archaeological excavation reveals the close relationship between the locals and the whales.

當地有關鯨魚的傳說故事，分別是能登町的「藤波」、「波並」、「矢波」。

「藤波」：於三四百年前，有位村莊的老人因自覺受村人照顧，在臨死前說往生後要變成鯨魚來回報村莊。死後隔天村人在當地寺廟海藏院前的海灘發現有鯨魚擱淺，便傳說是老人說的諾言實現。

「波並」：相傳1673年時有頭約59公尺的鯨魚擱淺在小島上，被島民發現後馬上將鯨魚分解，後被其他村民發現，告發至政府官員。後來決定將鯨魚肉分發給村莊。後人將那個小島稱為鯨島。

「矢波」：1664年庄次兵衛受村民照顧，承諾死後化身鯨魚報恩的故事，跟第一個故事很雷同。

‘Fujinami’, ‘Hanami’, and ‘Yanami’ of Noto City are three local legends related to whales.

Fujinami: Three or four hundred years ago, an old village man felt he was taken care of by the villagers and revealed at his death that he would return as a whale to repay the village. The following day after his death, the villagers found a whale stranded on the beach in front of the local temple Kaizoin. They believed that the old man's wish came true.

Hanami: Legend has it that in 1673 a 59-meter whale was stranded on the small island. The whale got immediately disassembled after being discovered by the islanders. It was reported to the government officials by other villagers, and as a result, the whale meat got distributed within the village. Later generations named the island Whale Island.

Yanami: Similar to the first legend, in the year 1664, a Shojibei decided to repay the villagers who had taken great care of him by returning as a whale after his death.

珠洲市也有相似的傳說，一位祖母因管理不善而燒毀房屋，感到遺憾之際曾說她死後會變成鯨魚來報償。老婦去世幾年後，該村被指控支付了巨款。第二年一條大鯨魚被吸引到海灘上，在那裡被出售，村莊因此還清債務，據說這頭鯨是祖母幻變回來回報的。

這個考古遺跡的出土，是鯨魚骨骸化石？是陸行鯨化石？是陸行鯨演化成鯨魚的證據？還是與當地的傳說有關？就有待考古學家研究之後，來為我們解答謎底。

A similar legend took place in Suzu City of an old grandmother who had her house burned due to mismanagement. Feeling regretful, she worded that after her passing she would return as a whale to repay everything. A few years after the old woman passed away, the village got accused of disbursing a large sum of money. The following year a giant whale was drawn to the beach and sold there, which allowed the villagers to pay off their debt. The whale is said to be the old woman’s return.

What does this latest archaeological find reveal? The fossil of a whale or a walking whale? Evidence of the walking whales evolving to whales? Is it connected to the local legends? With the archaeological studies in progress, we will be unearthing the mystery very soon.
