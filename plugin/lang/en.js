It was reported to the government officials by other villagers, and as a result, the whale meat got distributed within the village. Later generations named the island Whale Island.",

      t5: "A similar legend took place in Suzu City of an old grandmother who had her house burned due to mismanagement. Feeling regretful, she worded that after her passing she would return as a whale to repay everything. A few years after the old woman passed away, the village got accused of disbursing a large sum of money. The following year a giant whale was drawn to the beach and sold there, which allowed the villagers to pay off their debt. The whale is said to be the old woman’s return.",

This skeleton fossil of the man-like figure measures about 6.5 metres long and the snake about 12 metres long. The man-like skull completes with a set of fangs while the giant snakehead has a broken horn at its centre. Based on the position of the skeletons, the snake bites on the left arm of the man-like figure, and it grabs the snake with the right hand. The giant snake wraps around the giant figure in three circles.",
      t2: "The relics are arguably the most significant archaeological discovery in Thailand in recent years. Its potential to prove the existence of the giants of ancient civilisations and to confirm the myths as historical events is worthy of attention. An international team composed of French, Taiwanese and Scottish archaeologists has been stationed there for further investigation. The site surfaced on November 15, 2017, and was unveiled to the public on November 2, 2018. So to learn about the excavation process as well as the connection between the ruins and the myths and legends of Krabi Province, the local news interviewed Mr Félix Blume, the head of the archaeological team, and Mr Niwat Wathanayomnaporn, a local scholar who had worked with the American Dr Douglas Anderson in the excavation work in Krabi more than 30 years back.",

In the end, both died, turning into the large and small Krabi peaks, and the two swords were lost forever. Rumour has it, in 1872, local villagers unearthed two ancient swords in Ban Na Luang area and presented them to government officials, but then nobody knew where the swords ended up. Meanwhile, the emblem of Krabi Province illustrates the two ancient crossed swords from the legend placed in front of the background of the Indian Ocean and Phanom Tea Mountain, the auspicious symbol of the development of the region. The preserved site is still on display in one of the stalactite caves in Khao Khanap Nam.",

Standing beside the French windows at the foot of the staircase, the UFO-like object seems to have flown in and landed itself in the gallery just moments ago, or perhaps ready to take off towards the waters outside. Halfway down the stairs, at the corner, stands an object labelled excavation number BM0803. It is a sculpture of a deity with one body and multiple heads. All faces appear mechanical, and all heads connect to one same structure, which hints at multiple identities.",

But a closer look reveals that all the flowers and butterflies are composed of industrial scraps.",
